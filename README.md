# Project-1
Elevator Pitch: I’m going out for a trail ride in 30 minutes with my best friend. I need to pick a trail… 
We’re going to be hungry when we’re done, but I don’t know what’s around that trail. 
Where should I look? Trail Mix! Eat, Ride & Be Merry

Concept: User Story/Motivation: As a cyclist I want to find places to eat and drink while I'm riding. 
Trail Mix helps me do that.
Input your desired location to find a trail. Then click your desired trail for restaurants/bars/coffee shops along your route.

Process:
APIs used: MapQuest for geolocation and restaurants & MTB Project for trails
Framework: Materialize

Roles: Back End: Kevin & Evan 		Front End: Kelly & Audra
We added project tasks to the Project inside of GitHub. 

Challenges: Finding a good restaurant API and getting the restaurants to populate in between the lines of trail options. 

Demo: 

Future Development:
